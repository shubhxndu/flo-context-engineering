High-Risk Bash CommandsThis document lists commands that can pose a significant risk to your project's integrity, especially in a production environment. For this Next.js and FastAPI project deployed on Heroku with a Supabase database, these commands should be handled with extreme caution.Never run these commands without a complete understanding of their impact and a recent backup of your data.File System CommandsCommands that modify, delete, or change permissions on files and directories.Command to remove files recursively: This command is used to delete files and directories. When used with certain flags, it can permanently erase entire directory trees without confirmation.Command to change file ownership: This command changes the owner of a file or directory. Incorrect usage could lead to permission issues, preventing your application from accessing critical resources.Command to change file permissions: This command modifies file permissions. Careless use can grant unauthorized users access or, conversely, lock you out of your own files.Database Commands (Supabase via CLI)Commands that can irreversibly alter or delete database data.Command to drop a database: This command is used to delete a database. When connected to your Supabase instance, this could permanently delete all your data.Command to execute a raw SQL command: This command allows you to run any SQL statement directly on your database. A command like TRUNCATE TABLE or DELETE FROM could wipe out large portions of your data.Command to reset a database state: This command is often used to reset your local development database. However, if accidentally pointed at your production environment, it could erase all data.Deployment & Heroku CommandsCommands that can alter your deployed application or environment variables.Command to destroy an application: This is a Heroku CLI command that permanently deletes your application and all associated data, including add-ons and resources.Command to run a one-off dyno: This command runs a one-time process on Heroku. If the command run is malicious or destructive, it could impact your production app.Command to change a config variable: This command is used to modify environment variables. Incorrectly changing a database URL or API key could break your application or, in a worst-case scenario, expose credentials.Version Control CommandsCommands that can irreversibly alter your project's Git history.Command to rewrite history: This command is a powerful tool for rewriting commit history. Improper use can lead to lost commits and create a mess for other team members.Command to force push a branch: This command is used to force a push to a remote repository, overwriting the remote branch with your local version. It can permanently delete commits and cause major issues for collaborators.Command to delete a branch: This command deletes a local or remote Git branch. While often necessary, accidentally deleting a critical branch before its changes are merged is a high-risk operation.Command to undo commits: This command is used to revert commits, but can lead to a messy commit history and is often an "avoidable strategy" in favor of more reversible commands like git revert. Improper use can lead to lost work.Why You Shouldn't Run These CommandsThe core principle of a robust deployment workflow is predictability and safety. By avoiding these commands in your daily routine, you prevent accidents that could lead to:Data Loss: Irreversible deletion of user data, business logic, and project files.Downtime: Your application becomes inaccessible to users.Security Vulnerabilities: Accidental exposure of credentials or sensitive data.Broken Deployments: Your application fails to build or run.Ask the agent to not write any of these commands. By keeping this file in your project, you have a clear reminder of the commands to approach with extreme caution.
